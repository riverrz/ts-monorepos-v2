## DateTime type

Plant and Seed Packet Data Model

This file defines the complete data structure for representing plants, seeds, and their characteristics for garden planning and plant placement optimization.

Key Concepts for Non-Gardeners: - Annual: Lives one growing season (e.g., tomatoes, lettuce) - Perennial: Lives multiple years (e.g., fruit trees, asparagus) - Companion Planting: Some plants grow better together, others inhibit each other - Succession Planting: Planting the same crop multiple times for continuous harvest - Hardiness Zone: Geographic regions based on average minimum winter temperatures

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type DateTime = string;
```
